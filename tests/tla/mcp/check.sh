# Model-check the MCP engine models (src/mcp/) with TLC.
#
# run.py reads catalog.json: each model's smoke config must pass, and each
# planted bug in <Module>.mutants.json must be caught by its named property.
# Pass run.py's selection flags through, for example:
#   ./check.sh --model Engine Request
#   ./check.sh --unit U12
#
# The trace bridge and the scenarios that run the real code are in
# ../drivers/mcp/:
#   bun test ../drivers/mcp/bridge.test.ts
#   bun ../drivers/mcp/driver.ts --list
#
# Needs Java 11+, python3, and tla2tools.jar, as ../README.md describes.
