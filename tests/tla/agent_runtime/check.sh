# Model-check the empty-reply nudge in the agent step loop
# (src/core/agent/runtime/orchestrator.zig) with TLC and require each
# config's expected verdict.
#
# empty-reply.cfg and empty-reply-deep.cfg are the design and must pass.
# empty-reply-today.cfg is fx before it, which ended an empty reply that
# stopped for `other` with "Done." (EverySeparateEmptyNudged). Each
# empty-reply-mutation-*.cfg plants one defect, and the rule it names must
# catch it:
#
#   no-reset          a nudge flag that survives a step that made progress  EverySeparateEmptyNudged
#   double-nudge      a nudge sent again for the reply to a nudge           NoDoubleNudge
#   ignore-limit      a nudge sent with no step left                        StepsBounded
#   placeholder       a second empty reply ends with "Done."                NoPlaceholder
#   nudge-text        a reply with text that stops for other is nudged      NudgeOnlyAfterEmptyOther
#   summarize-first   "Summarize what you just did." sent instead           EverySeparateEmptyNudged
#
# EmptyReplyTrace.tla checks turns of the built fx binary against the model;
# tests/tla/drivers/agent_runtime/driver.ts runs it.
#
# Needs Java 11+ and tla2tools.jar, as ../README.md describes.
#
# Usage:
#   ./check.sh
#   ./check.sh empty-reply empty-reply-mutation-no-reset
#   TLA2TOOLS_JAR=/path/tla2tools.jar ./check.sh
set -eu
