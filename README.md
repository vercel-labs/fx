fx is a coding agent harness and CLI written in Zig, optimized for research and embeddability as part of larger systems.

It focuses on minimalism and performance across the board, from system prompt design to its tools, feature set, and 7.8 MiB binary.

For end users, its CLI output style and form factor aim to be closer to a Unix shell than a heavy "IDE in the terminal" TUI.

It's open source (Apache-2.0), model-agnostic, and suitable for both local and cloud inference.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fx.sh/setup.sh | bash
```

## Run fx

OpenPaths is the default provider. With `OPENPATHS_API_KEY` (or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) in the environment, fx works immediately with no login or setup:

```bash
export OPENPATHS_API_KEY=...   # or OPENROUTER_API_KEY
fx
```

The default model is `openpaths/stealth/ox-alpha`. When that model is unavailable, fx circuit-breaks to `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` for the rest of the turn and shows a recovered banner. `/model` lists the provider's live catalog, and **Switch provider** in `/setup` moves between OpenPaths, Gateway, Codex, and Grok.

Sign in with Vercel AI Gateway:

```bash
fx login
```

Or use an eligible ChatGPT subscription through OpenAI Codex OAuth:

```bash
fx login codex
fx
```

Or use an eligible Grok subscription through xAI OAuth:

```bash
fx login grok
fx
```

`fx login codex` and `fx login grok` select that provider and a model from its authenticated catalog. Inside fx, open `/setup` and choose **Switch provider** to move between Gateway, Codex, and Grok. `/model` lists the active provider's fetched models. Subscription model IDs are the raw IDs returned by each authenticated catalog. Use `/logout codex` or `/logout grok` to remove that subscription session without affecting other providers; choosing it again from **Switch provider** starts sign-in.

The OpenAI Codex route uses ChatGPT subscription access directly and never sends its OAuth token to Vercel AI Gateway. The session is stored privately at `~/.fx/chatgpt-auth.json` and refreshed when needed. On supported Codex models, `/fast` requests OpenAI's priority service tier and consumes ChatGPT credits at the higher Fast mode rate.

The Grok route uses subscription access directly at xAI and never sends its OAuth token to Vercel AI Gateway or OpenAI. Its session is stored privately at `~/.fx/grok-auth.json`, refreshed when needed, and used only with the authenticated xAI catalog and Responses API.

To use an AI Gateway API key instead:

```bash
fx setup
```

Run fx from a project:

```bash
cd your_project
fx
```

The current directory becomes the primary workspace. Enter a prompt, or run `/help` to browse interactive commands.

The status line hides the workspace path and Git branch by default. Enable the `Status line workspace` option in `/settings`, run `/statusline workspace`, or set it in `~/.fx/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "workspace": true
  }
}
```

List saved sessions with `fx sessions`. Resume the latest session for the current workspace, or select an exact session ID, through the same command group:

```bash
fx session resume last
fx session resume --id <id>
```

Each interactive session names its terminal tab. The title prefers the session name, falls back to the workspace name, and keeps the active model as secondary context. Renaming or resuming a session updates the tab, and exiting clears the fx-owned title. Noninteractive commands do not emit terminal-title controls.

Run `/feedback` to open the feedback form at `fx.sh/feedback`. It does not create a diagnostic or change the clipboard.

Run `/trace` to create a private Markdown diagnostic with logs, session context, runtime state, permissions, and recent activity. On macOS, fx copies the `.md` file to the clipboard; on other platforms, it saves the file and prints its path. Review and redact the trace before sharing it.

Use `fx ask` for a single request:

```bash
fx ask "explain the changes in this repository"
```

## fx infinity

fx infinity is the infinite run harness: one `fx ask` invocation that keeps working across turns until you interrupt it. After every completed turn, the saved session receives a generated follow-up prompt built from the latest work summary, so progress compounds instead of stopping at the first answer.

```bash
# keep executing the next logical implementation steps, forever
fx ask --auto-next-steps --yolo "fix the failing tests and improve the implementation"

# finish the current plan, then brainstorm and ship improvements, forever
fx ask --auto-next-idea --yolo "polish the terminal renderer"

# both: alternate between next steps and next ideas until interrupted
fx ask --auto-next-steps --auto-next-idea --yolo "harden the gateway client"
```

How the cycle runs:

- `--auto-next-steps`: after each turn, breaks the overall goal into concrete next steps and executes them in order, running relevant tests along the way.
- `--auto-next-idea`: after the current plan is done, shifts into ideation mode, brainstorms at least three concrete improvements, picks the highest-impact one, and starts executing immediately.
- Together they form an unbounded loop; every third single-flag turn also re-reviews recent work against the original objective before acting.
- Failed turns retry automatically with exponential backoff (1s doubling to 16s), resuming the same saved session. Non-retryable failures exit nonzero.
- Stop anytime with Ctrl+C. Sessions are always saved, so `fx ask --resume last` picks the harness back up later.

Autonomous mode requires session saving and cannot be combined with `--no-save`. Pair it with `--json` to get one parseable result object per turn on stdout.

fx starts in `auto` permission mode. Routine understood development actions run directly; unresolved sensitive actions receive one bounded automatic review. A blocked action may return an exact approval request that the agent can send to fx's real permission screen. Ordinary question text never grants permission. See [Permissions](https://fx.sh/docs/configure-fx/permissions) for other modes and persistent rules.

JSON and quiet requests stay noninteractive by default. Add `--prompt-permissions` to allow the existing Y/N approval prompt when stdin is a TTY. Prompt text is written to stderr, so JSON stdout stays parseable and quiet stdout stays empty. Piped or redirected stdin remains noninteractive and fails instead of waiting for approval.

Inside a saved session, `/permissions remember <allow|deny> <tool-name> <arguments-json>` stores an exact confirmed rule without running the action. `/permissions` lists stable rule IDs, and `/permissions revoke <rule-id>` removes a stored rule even when its original workspace or file state has changed.

## Embed fx

fx builds as a native binary or WebAssembly. Applications embedding fx can provide network transport, session storage, configuration, permission handling, and terminal I/O.

| Surface | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `fx acp` | Connect the native agent to editors and other Agent Client Protocol clients. |
| `createFxAgent()` | Embed the agent core in a JavaScript host with `fx-core.wasm`. |
| `createFxTerminal()` | Embed the interactive terminal with `fx-term.wasm`. |

The WebAssembly SDK is experimental. See the [WebAssembly SDK](sdk/README.md) and [ACP documentation](https://fx.sh/docs/using-fx/acp).

## Extend fx

Add reusable instructions with [skills](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/skills), connect external tools through [MCP](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/mcp), or delegate independent work to [subagents](https://fx.sh/docs/capabilities/subagents). Project instruction files may link within their scope, and read-only workspace or compatibility skill directories and their primary `SKILL.md` files may link within their owning workspace or home; managed skills, secondary resources, and escaping links remain no-follow. Skills installed via symlinks that resolve outside home or workspace (e.g. Nix store paths) are loaded when their resolved target is inside a directory listed in the `FX_SKILL_SYMLINK_AUTHORITIES` environment variable (colon-separated absolute paths). `fx status` and `fx doctor` report an invalid trusted MCP profile without starting its servers.

## Documentation
